# Sample Election Results JSON Files

To assist with testing, four mock results files are available.
Candidate names have been changed to avoid showing favouritism,
but are consistent across the four files.

- [resultsJSON-0-start.json](resultsJSON-0-start.json)<br />
  The beginning of the evening, before any votes have been reported.

- [resultsJSON-1-halfWay.json](resultsJSON-1-halfWay.json)<br />
  Roughly half of the polls have reported their counts.

- [resultsJSON-2-ward2down.json](resultsJSON-2-ward2down.json)<br />
  Uh oh!  There's a problem communicating with a Ward 2 polling station.
  All results from Ward 2 are withheld.

- [resultsJSON-3-complete.json](resultsJSON-3-complete.json)<br />
  All of the polling stations have reported their counts.
  The election is over.

[Find out what the fields in these files mean](../resultsJSON.md).
